# pizza-sales-sql-project
Overview:
Analyzed real-world transactional data from a pizza chain using SQL to explore business-relevant metrics and derive insights for smarter decision-making and performance improvement.
I used MySQL to run queries on four connected datasets: customer orders, pizza types, pricing, and order details.
The project simulates real-world business scenarios to identify top-selling products, revenue trends, and areas for operational optimization.

Objective:
To apply core SQL skills to perform end-to-end data analysis on a pizza sales dataset. The goal is to interpret key metrics, uncover trends, and present findings that can support data-driven business strategies related to product performance, revenue, and efficiency.

Resolution:
Through detailed SQL analysis, I uncovered valuable insights by answering a range of business-focused questionsâ€”from basic to advanced levels. This project involved analyzing real-world transactional data to explore key performance indicators such as revenue patterns, popular items, and order behavior.
By applying various SQL techniques including joins, aggregations, filtering, and conditional logic etc, I extracted meaningful, data-driven insights that can assist in strategic decision-making for operations and marketing.
